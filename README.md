## Overview

Welcome to the Fast Food Marketing Campaign A/B Test project! The goal of this project is to meticulously evaluate the 
outcomes of A/B testing, enabling us to discern the most effective marketing approach for introducing a new menu item. 
Through a comprehensive exploration of the data, we aim to make informed decisions that will maximize the impact of 
the marketing campaigns and drive sales growth.

## Data
The dataset for this project originates from a scenario where a fast-food chain is on the brink of introducing a new 
item to its menu. Confronted with the challenge of selecting the optimal marketing strategy, the chain conducted an 
A/B test across various markets. Here's a breakdown of the dataset's key components:

MarketID: A unique identifier for each market.

MarketSize: The market's size, categorized by sales volume.

LocationID: A unique identifier for each store location.

AgeOfStore: The age of the store in years.

Promotion: One of three distinct marketing promotions that were tested.

Week: One of four weeks during which the promotions were executed.

SalesInThousands: The recorded sales amount for a specific LocationID, Promotion, and week.

By examining this dataset, the aim is to uncover the nuanced relationships between market characteristics, store attributes,
promotional strategies, and the resulting sales performance. Through exploratory analysis and data-driven insights, 
I intend to provide valuable recommendations for shaping the future marketing endeavors of the fast-food chain.
